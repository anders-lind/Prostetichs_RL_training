This project aims to use MyoAssist to train and compare different reinforcement learning algorithms for use in prosthetics.

Changes have been made to the original repository to use different reinforcement learning models and prosthetic models.

Read README_MyoAssist.md for the installation guide for MyoAssist and a overview of the MyoAssist project

To train this model use:

python rl_train/run_train.py --config_file_path rl_train/train/train_configs/my_imitation_OSL_ankle_22_separated_net_partial_obs.json
